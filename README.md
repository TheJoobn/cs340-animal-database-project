# cs340-animal-database-project
Project for CS-340-10797 Client/Server Development

    1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I like to keep functions short, use clear names, comment important parts, and split logic into separate files if needed. The CRUD operations from Project One made it easy to connect everything and bring it together in Project Two. I passed query dictionaries into the read() method, which made the code cleaner and easier to reuse. I could use what I learned in this class again for any project that involves basic database and UI operations.

    2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I approach a problem, especially complex ones with many layers, I break it down into the simplest tasks and criteria. For this project, I started by figuring out what the filters needed to do, then translated that into MongoDB queries. I had to think about how the backend and frontend worked together. For future projects, I will plan queries and layout early to make changes easier, and I will make sure I have everything well documented with clearly defined steps.

    3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists build tools and applications that solve real world and virtual problems. The dashboard I created in Project Two helps Grazioso Salvare quickly find animals that meet specific rescue needs. It saves time and helps them make better, more efficient decisions. Projects like this show how coding can make real tasks faster, more effective, and more user friendly.
